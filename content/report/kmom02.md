Design part 2
==================

In this part 2 of the course, I quite frankly struggle with the whole concept of SASS and all the techniques used. I followed the guide and the video lecture but in my mind I dont have it clear which what does. 

The theme I had created suddenly dissapeared with the overturning it to SASS. My main idea is to create a relax and calm theme with some retro vibes, like going back in time, something like a postcard.

I have not divided my code, I think, as I am still figuring out what I was doing. I fell it is very comlplicated material.
