Design part 1
==================

I have never worked in such an environment so for me it was confusing and complicated in the beginning. Different problems kept arising all the time, from the size of the pictures to not being able to understand properly all the git commands and the terminology in general. I still do not understand how would an exercise like that be executed in the real (programming) world if we did not have the example.
My TIL is basically everything that this kmom consists of.
